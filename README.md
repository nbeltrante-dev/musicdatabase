# musicdatabase
Database Systems (CMSC 366) Project where I created and queried a music database.

This lab assignment helped me build skills on table creation, modification, and querying in SQL.

Questions Were:

1. Create Database

2. Write a query to retrieve the track number and composition title of all tracks on the album titled “Giant Steps”.

3. Write a query to retrieve the first and last names of the musicians, along with the instruments they played, for the May 4, 1959 recording of the composition titled “Giant Steps”.

4. Write a query to retrieve the first and last names of all people who have both composed music for at least one composition and played tenor sax on at least one recording. Each person should only be listed once in the results.

5. Write a query to retrieve the composition title, track number, and album title of any composition that appears as multiple tracks on the same album. Sort the data by composition title (ascending) and then track number (ascending). Note that this should include two different recordings of the same composition, such as the two recordings of “Countdown” that occurs on “Giant Steps”.

6. Write a query to retrieve the recording ID and recording date of all recordings that appear on every album. Write the query using the EXISTS keyword.

7. Write another query to retrieve the recording ID and recording date of all recordings that appear on every album. This time do not use the EXISTS keyword.
